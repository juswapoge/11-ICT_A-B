  <b>1<sup>st</sup> Generation</b>
  </p>
  <dd>
    The Computers of first generation used vacuum as the basic components to memory and circruirity for CPU in this generation, mainly batch processing operating system was used. Punch card, paper tape, and magnetic tape was used as input and ouput device.

      <b>2<sup>nd</sup> Generation</b>
       </p>
      <dd>
        Transistors were used in this generation that were cheaper, consumed less power, more reliable and faster. In this generation magnetic cores were used as primary memory. In this generation assembly language and high level programming languages like Fortran, Cobol

      <b>3<sup>rd</sup> Generation</b>
      </p>
      
     <dd>
        The computers of third generation used integrated circuits in place of transistors. In this generation remote processing, time sharing, multiprogramming operating system were used.

      <b>4<sup>th</sup> Generation </b>
      </p>
      
      <dd>
        Computer of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI have about 5000 transistors with their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have micro computers. As a result it gave rise to Personal Computer (PC). All the high level languages like c, c++, DBASE etc., were used in this generation.

      <dd>
        This generation is based on parallel hardware and AI(Artificila Intelligence) software.All the high-level language like C++,Java,Net,etc,are used in these generation.
